Distances on Sirocco
====================

Daner Zone's second map (after [Blacksite](Blacksite.md)) has similar distances
to its companion, but the spaces tend to be more open. Engagements still take
place at long range, and thanks to the removal of the fog, you can see your
enemies from even further away than on Blacksite.
