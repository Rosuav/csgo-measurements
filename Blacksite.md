Distances on Blacksite
======================

The battle royale mode "Danger Zone", introduced in 2018, features wider open
spaces than classic modes do. Engagements tend to take place at greater ranges,
the detonation of C4 doesn't end the game (although it can still be heard over
the whole map - Valve pls fix), and it's possible to have theoretical line of
sight across such distance that rifle bullets actually stop being tracked.

Width of Radio
--------------

Entire courtyard: ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Mark.png "Southeast corner of Radio")

~2600 HU to the opposite corner - approximately the same as [bottom mid to T
spawn on Dust II](DustII.md#mid-to-t-spawn).

* Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Width.png "2600 HU across Radio")
* Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Width_scope1.png "2600 HU at scope 1")
* Double-scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Width_scope2.png "2600 HU at scope 2")

Main building: ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Mark2.png "Southeast corner of Radio")

1000 HU from door to door. TODO: Get these shots with AWP too for comparison.

* Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_DoortoDoor.png "1000 HU across Radio")
* Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_DoortoDoor_scope1.png "1000 HU at SG-553 scope")

500 HU ruler
------------

* The open space at the top of Radio gives an easy 500 HU ruler. TODO: Redo this
with two people standing 500 HU apart, looking at each other.

  - From here ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Top.png "500 HU open space")

  - To here ![](images/Blacksite_Radio_Top_500.png "500 HU open space, other side")

* Another 500 HU ruler can be found at Delta. The house front is just over 500 HU wide.

  - From here ![](images/Blacksite_Delta_Front.png "500 HU across Delta")

  - To here ![](images/Blacksite_Delta_Front_500.png "500 HU across Delta, other side")

Water tower
-----------

Marked location: ![](images/Blacksite_Watertower_Mark.png "King of the world!")

* To the pier east of Gas Station: 4000 HU
  - Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Watertower_4000.png "4000 HU to the pier")
  - Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Watertower_4000_scope1.png "4000 HU at scope 1")
  - Double-scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Watertower_4000_scope2.png "4000 HU at scope 2")

TODO: Get some more measurements like these (probably again with two people).
Would it be useful to measure to Radio (circa 6K HU)?

Box sizing
----------

(Border box.)

* Green container near Trench (TODO: check if it's the same for other shipping
containers): 427 HU
  - From here ![](images/Blacksite_Container_Mark.png "<500 HU")
  - To here ![](images/Blacksite_Container_427.png "<500 HU")
* Dronegun box: 154 x 178 HU
  - From here ![](images/Blacksite_Dronegun_Mark.png "Shared corner")
  - Short side (width) ![](images/Blacksite_Dronegun_Width.png "Width - 154 HU")
  - Long side (length) ![](images/Blacksite_Dronegun_Length.png "Length - 178 HU")

Alpha
-----

Marked location: ![](images/Blacksite_Alpha_Mark.png "Alpha at the top of the stairs")

1000 HU to the shed.

* Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Alpha_Shed.png "1000 HU")
* Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Alpha_Shed_scope1.png "1000 HU at scope 1")
* Double-scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Alpha_Shed_scope2.png "1000 HU at scope 2")

Tunnels
-------

Marked location: ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_Mark.png "Tunnels, looking north")

1000 HU to the next corner.

* Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_North.png "1000 HU")
* Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_North_scope1.png "1000 HU at scope 1")
* Double-scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_North_scope2.png "1000 HU at scope 2")

Approaching from east instead: ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_Mark2.png "Tunnels, looking east")

1000 HU also.

* Unscoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_East.png "1000 HU")
* Scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_East_scope1.png "1000 HU at scope 1")
* Double-scoped ![](images/Blacksite_Tunnels_East_scope2.png "1000 HU at scope 2")
