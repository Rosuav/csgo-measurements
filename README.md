CS:GO Measurements
==================

[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) measures
all distances in [Hammer Units](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions)
or HUs. All data relating to distance is measured this way, but to get a visual
idea of how far that is, you'd need some way to calibrate yourself. The excellent
[SlothSquadron weapon stats spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tDzUNBq9zIX6_9Rel__fdAUezAQzSnh5AVYzCP060c/edit#gid=0)
shows the damage falloff at 500 HU, which is great to know, if only you know how
far that actually is. That's where this comes in.

The screenshots used here were taken from the latest (at time of writing) build
of CS:GO, using the maps as published by Valve. It is believed that this usage
comes under "fair use".

TODO: Check if there's any sort of copyright terms or anything that should go
there to support that.

TODO: Go through a large number of maps and get 1000 HU rulers on all of them
