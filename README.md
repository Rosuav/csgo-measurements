CS:GO Measurements
==================

[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) measures
all distances in [Hammer Units](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions)
or HUs. All data relating to distance is measured this way, but to get a visual
idea of how far that is, you'd need some way to calibrate yourself. The excellent
[SlothSquadron weapon stats spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tDzUNBq9zIX6_9Rel__fdAUezAQzSnh5AVYzCP060c/edit#gid=0)
shows the damage falloff at 500 HU, which is great to know, if only you know how
far that actually is. That's where this comes in.
